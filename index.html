    <p>Ever wondered what going freelance was like? Ask Jessica Hische. An American letterer, typographical artist and once described as an ‘avid internetter’ who needs no introduction, mastered the art of going freelance.</p>

<h2 id="career-start">The Start of Her Career</h2>
      <!-----INSERT IMAGE----->
    
    <p> After graduating in 2006 from Tyler School of Art with a degree in Graphic and Interactive Design, Jessica worked for Headcase Design in Philadelphia for a while before taking a position at Louise Fili Ltd. as senior designer. Here she learnt most of her lettering skills, spending up to 16 hours every day working between Fili and her freelance clients. 

        Jessica decided to leave in 2009 after two and a half years to focus on and further her freelance career, meaning she was able to embark on personal projects which were more fun. </p>

<h2 id="projects"> Jessica's Projects</h2>
        
       <!-----INSERT IMAGE----->

        <p>One of Jessica’s first freelance projects she started was called ‘Daily Drop Cap’, a project where she created a new illustrative letter every day, working through the whole alphabet for a total of 12 times over. The site at its peak had over 100,00 visitors each month, due to the success of this project a thirteenth alphabet was produced where guest contributors crafted a letter each. Hische has become as well known for her side projects as her client projects, although she does not consider herself as a web designer, she has created many educational web based projects such as <i>‘Mum This is How Twitter Works’</i>, <i>‘Should I work For Free’</i> etc. Hische came up with the term procrastiworking, describing how she often procrastinates on client work by finishing herself working on personal projects.</p>

        <p>Jessica loves a challenge. Working on projects outside her comfort zone, such as a recent project producing water colour paintings for a hospital. Ever since coming back to work after having a baby, she has had the mindset of going a little further, trying new projects. </p>
    
    <cite>As she once said,</cite>	

        <blockquote>“Whenever something that used to bring you joy no longer brings you joy, it’s time to try something new. It’s not that that thing will never give you joy again, it’s just that you need some time away”</blockquote>
        
        <p>So even as a new mum and moving house a few months later, she still continues to pursue freelance in the best way.</p>

        <p>Devotion to a particular client is a must for Jessica. Only taking on one logo project at a time means she can devote as much time and effort to the project, making sure she produces the best and only the best.</p>
        
        <h3>Some of Jessica’s clients include...</h3>

     />

A book that Jessica was inspired to write, since reading her child bedtime stories she saw a lack of themes regarding reflection on your day and setting intentions for the next. Jessica wanted to add an uplifting and empowering book to the shelves. The focus being that the kids would be the best they can be and introduce self-forgiveness. 

        <h3>Starbucks</h3>
        
          <!-----INSERT IMAGE----->

This project enabled some of Jessica’s work into physical things. In this instance her lettering was shown in a coffee cup shaped piece of chocolate. Jessica really shows how a designer’s work is unique every single day, from writing a book to designing type for Starbucks. Her commitment really is an example of how much she loves design. From working on Saturdays because she is so passionate about the project to heading to bed at 10pm incase she gets a 5am wake up call – the cons that come with freelance.

<h2 id="time-management">Time Management for the Freelancer</h2>
          <!-----INSERT IMAGE----->
        
        <p>For Jessica from juggling admin work when being self-employed, designing for top companies to looking after a crying, hungry baby can become tricky to balance it out evenly. Yet judging on her beautiful outcomes of her work she seems to master it pretty well. She advises having a particular day for admin work, avoiding having client deadlines on that day, perhaps doing work which isn’t paid but still needs to be done in order to progress to build up your profile and increase the number of clients. This structure means your weak is not killed by little things creeping up like interviews or the odd email. </p>
        
        <p>There’s a small line between fitting all your work in and being completely burnt out and it’s important not to fall into the latter part. Jessica gives the advice of scheduling her deliverables in a staggered way, which helps to break it up. It’s important to take a step back and breath sometimes, instead of being constantl bombarded with work 24/7. You can say NO to projects, 
            
        <blockquote>“The only thing that you can do is promise yourself you’ll be better in the future. I think that that’s the thing you always have to think about when you’re in the middle of a bad, ‘I’m not good at stuff’ phase”. The present is because of what decisions you’ve made in the past, not the ones you’re currently making.</blockquote><cite>Jessica Hiche</cite>
